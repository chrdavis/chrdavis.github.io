Shortly after I released [SmartRename](https://github.com/chrdavis/SmartRename) I discovered that some people at Microsoft were bringing back PowerToys.  I moved a copy of the code over to their repo and renamed SmartRename to PowerRename.  Finally, after getting dropped with the Windows Vista PowerToys 12 years ago, PowerRename finally ships!

Get [PowerRename](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/tree/master/src/modules/powerrename) and the rest of the [Microsoft PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)
