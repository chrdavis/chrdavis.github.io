Shortly after I released [SmartRename](https://github.com/chrdavis/SmartRename) I discovered that some people at Microsoft were bringing back PowerToys.  I moved a copy of the code over to their repo and renamed SmartRename to PowerRename.  Finally, after getting dropped with the Windows Vista PowerToys, PowerRename finally ships!

Get PowerRename and the rest of the Microsoft PowerToys at [](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys):
