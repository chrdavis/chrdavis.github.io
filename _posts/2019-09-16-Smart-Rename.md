I just released a new Windows Shell Extension - SmartRename.  It allows for simple search and replace or regular expression bulk renaming of files and folders.  I actually first wrote this extension back in 2007 after Windows Vista shipped.  It was supposed to be included in the Windows Vista PowerToys to showcase the capabilities of the new [file operations engine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ifileoperation) in Vista - which I worked on at the time.  Unfortunately, the Vista PowerToys got cancelled just as I finished it :/.  I had always wanted to get around to rewriting the extension from scratch and releasing it.  Finally after 12 years I found some time.

Code and installer available at the [SmartRename Repo Page](https://github.com/chrdavis/SmartRename):
